# Title
An investigation into a link between prefered coding language and mental health, with and
without influence from Stackoverflow

# Abstract
The findings of this study were that in the absence of stackoverflow depression increased up by 57%.
These findings were similar to those made by (Smith et al, 2014), but with a more robust method, and 
a larger smaple size.

# Intro 
This paper aims to find out why coders are so sad most of the time.

# Experimentation
A group of 60 code-monkeys were asked to complete a 2 day coding project with, or without
access to Stackoverflow. Through the use of observation and questionaires their mental deteriation 
was monitored for this duration. These coders were further split into third groups of 20 Matlab,
20 C++, and 20 Java to see if this conributed to the nature of the issues.

# Results
It was found that people who used C++ were more prone to many small breakdowns, where as Matlab users
had fewer breakdowns but of a much larger panic level per incident.

# Future work
Look into whether coffee access leads to more or fewer nervous breakdowns in coders

# Figures
Add figures to illustrate teary eyed coders

# Acknowledgements
We would like to thank the good people at stackoverflow
